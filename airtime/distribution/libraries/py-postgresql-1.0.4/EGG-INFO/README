About py-postgresql
===================

py-postgresql is a Python 3 package providing modules to work with PostgreSQL.
This includes a high-level driver, and many other tools that support a developer
working with PostgreSQL databases.

The goal of this project is to provide substantial convenience to Python
developers working with PostgreSQL.


Installation
------------

Installation *should* be as simple as::

	$ python3 ./setup.py install


More information about installation is available via::

	python -m postgresql.documentation.admin


Basic Driver Usage
------------------

Using PG-API is recommended as it provides more utility for the user::

	>>> import postgresql
	>>> db = postgresql.open('pq://user:password@host:port/database')
	>>> get_table = db.prepare("select * from information_schema.tables where table_name = $1")
	>>> for x in get_table("tables"):
	>>>  print(x)
	>>> print(get_table.first("tables"))

However, a DB-API 2.0 driver is provided: `postgresql.driver.dbapi20`.
